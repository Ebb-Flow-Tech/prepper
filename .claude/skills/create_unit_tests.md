When unit tests are needed to be created, please take note of the following:
- ALL of the needed contents and interactions are within /backend/tests/ folder.
- the mocks you will need are inside conftest.py. However, if there is a mock that is needed BUT not inside that file, please create it.
- unit tests are to be created inside the /tests/ folder
