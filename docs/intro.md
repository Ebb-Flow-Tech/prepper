We’re building a **kitchen-first recipe workspace** that treats a recipe not as a record in a database, but as a living, central object that chefs and operators actively work on. The core idea is a single, always-focused “recipe canvas” where one dish is in the spotlight at any given time. Everything else—ingredient lists, instructions, and cost outputs—exists only to support that active context. The system is designed to feel tactile and obvious, relying on dragging, reordering, freeform text, and immediate visual feedback rather than forms or technical abstractions.

The primary goal is to make recipe creation and maintenance effortless for non-technical kitchen staff while simultaneously producing structured, reliable data that finance and operations can trust. Freeform instructions are encouraged and then transformed into structured steps, ingredients are attached by dragging them into a recipe, and costing is calculated automatically from consistent baselines. Users never “save,” navigate complex flows, or think about data models; the system continuously reflects the current state of the dish as they edit it.

At a principles level, the product prioritizes **clarity, immediacy, and reversibility**. There is no authentication, no multi-page navigation, and no hidden state—just a single shared workspace that autosaves, can be undone, and makes its assumptions visible. The architecture intentionally separates authoritative data (ingredients, quantities, yields) from derived representations (formatted instructions, costing breakdowns), enabling the system to stay simple today while remaining extensible tomorrow. This creates a pragmatic foundation that works equally well for chefs in the kitchen, finance teams reviewing margins, and future automation or LLM-driven workflows layered on top.
