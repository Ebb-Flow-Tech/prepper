## [0.0.16] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- Parallel email (SendGrid) and SMS (Twilio) delivery in single API call
- Graceful degradation if Twilio not configured—falls back to email-only without errors
- SMS includes session name, date, location, and invite link in plain text format
- Participant phone numbers managed through `TastingParticipant` type with optional `phone_number` field
- API response includes `email_count` and `sms_count` for delivery transparency

- `TastingUserRead` DTO displays participant names and emails from User table (instead of email strings)
- Email-to-user resolution in service layer (`_resolve_attendees_to_users()`) with silent skipping of unregistered emails
- Access control: non-admin users can only access sessions they participate in (403 Forbidden otherwise)
- Admin users bypass participant check for unrestricted access
- Backward compatibility: `attendees` field retained on request DTOs for wire compatibility

**Database Changes**:
- New `TastingUser` model as join table
- Alembic migration creates `tasting_users` table
- Cascade delete on session deletion, SET NULL on user deletion
- Unique constraint on (session_id, user_id) prevents duplicate participation

**API Changes**:

- Non-admin GET/PATCH/DELETE now require user participation or admin status
- Email lookup happens transparently during create/update operations

**Frontend**:
- New `ParticipantPicker` component for user selection during session creation
- Uses existing `useUsers()` hook for user lookup
- Supports search by username or email
- Displays selected user badges with removal capability

**Test Coverage**:
- 26/26 tests passing with participant resolution and access control validation
- Tests verify unregistered email skipping and admin access override

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/app/models/tasting.py` — Added `TastingUser` and `TastingUserRead`

**Components**:
- `MenuBuilder.tsx` — Main component managing drag-drop state and operations
- `DraggableSection` — Section wrapper with drag handle
- `DraggableItem` — Item wrapper with drag handle

## [0.0.9] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

#### Enum-to-VARCHAR Mismatch

The `/api/v1/ingredients` endpoint was returning 500 errors due to a mismatch between Python Enum types and database VARCHAR storage.

**Root Cause**: The Alembic migration created `category` and `source` as VARCHAR columns, but the SQLModel used Python Enums without explicit `sa_column`. SQLModel interpreted these as native PostgreSQL ENUMs using member **names** (FMH, MANUAL) instead of **values** (fmh, manual), causing `LookupError` on read.

**Fix**: Changed `Ingredient` model to use explicit `sa_column=Column(String(...))` for enum-like fields, ensuring VARCHAR storage.

```python
# Before (broken)
source: IngredientSource = Field(default=IngredientSource.MANUAL)

# After (fixed)
source: str = Field(
    default="manual",
    sa_column=Column(String(20), nullable=False, default="manual")
)
```

**Files Modified**: `backend/app/models/ingredient.py`

#### CORS Origins Update

Added Vercel deployment domain to allowed CORS origins:

```
https://prepper-one.vercel.app
```

**Docs**: `docs/completions/enum-varchar-fix.md`
